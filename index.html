                <p> Hi, I'm Chaithanya.M.C, My background includes a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from
                    Prathyusha Engineering College. I'M A STUDENT WHO IS ENTHUSIAST IN BUILDING NEW THINGS IN AN 
                    INNOVATIVE WAY WITH DRIVEN SECURITY AND A PASSIONATE COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WANTS TO WORK IN 
                    MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT BY UTILIZING MY SKILLS TO THE BEST.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and
                    management here at the Illinois institute of technology. It's a pleasure to address you all today
                    and give you a glimpse into my journey and what lies ahead.

                    Looking beyond my degree, I have clear intentions for my future. My goal is to develop code and 
                    building software services. This will allow me to develop end-to-end solutions independently and
                     contribute effectively to full-stack development projects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Before embarking on this academic journey, I was fortunate enough to have some prior experience in
                    programming and IT. I was working in Regami Solutions for 4 months.

                    One of my hobbies that I'm deeply passionate about is playing badminton. Engaging in this sport
                    brings me immense joy and allows me to unwind and recharge.</p>
